# Welcome Aboard- Cedar
## This is a redesign of my portfolio website. 

After a few thought on what I could do to spice up my portfolio website I decided a spice up was long overdue.

With this recreation I made sure to include all the features I yearned for and better technologies for SEO and load optimization

Some of the features I wanted to add was scroll animation, more personality with less and a blog.

### So for this, here are the technologies used:

* Astro - For better load speed, less weight and HTML flexiblity for SEO.
* GSAP - For scroll based animation.
* Sanity - As a headless CMS for easy handling of CRUD functionalities.

### That's all for now, thanks for sticking around.
